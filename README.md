# MUSIC SALES ANALYSIS

### OBJECTIVE -

### INSIGHTS / RESULT - 
In today's globalized soundscape, there's no denying that hip-hop culture has become a pervasive force, its beats and rhymes echoing from every corner of the world. It's a vibrant, ever-evolving genre that has captured the hearts and minds of millions, influencing everything from fashion to language.
However, rewind to the 1970s, and you'd find a starkly different musical landscape dominating the airwaves and concert halls. This was the undisputed zenith of rock music. From stadium-filling anthems to raw, rebellious punk, rock was the pulsating heartbeat of a generation. Legendary bands and iconic guitar riffs defined an era, making it the supreme cultural touchstone. The sheer energy and diverse subgenres of rock at its peak left an indelible mark, shaping youth culture and challenging norms in a way that resonates even today.
